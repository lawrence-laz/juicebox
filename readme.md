- [ ] Tweening (screenshake)
- [ ] "LookAt" method


- [ ] OnTrigger event
- [ ] JuiceBox.CopyEntity(Entity) - could just use factory method instead
- [ ] Scenes
- [ ] Raycasting/circle casting for mouse click detection? 

---
Try to have a working breakout game at the end

## Out of scope
- [ ] Coroutines
- [ ] Reload sprites and sounds during runtime
- [ ] Particles
- [ ] GUI (9slicing, scaling, layouts, etc.)
- [ ] Systems (should be just entities?)
- [ ] tilemaps
- [ ] use font via link? would be pretty cool, with main font providers integrated so just copy paste? much to support though
- [ ] awaitable animations
